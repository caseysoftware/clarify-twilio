Making Twilio Call Recordings Searchable
================

_This call may be recorded for quality assurance._

You’ve heard it a thousand times but how often is it true? How often does a company record those calls? More importantly, what do they do with those recordings?

Many organizations don’t do anything with the recordings. They go into the giant network storage in the sky to collect digital dust. Other organizations attach the recordings to customer records along with some notes and call it a day. Finally, other organizations are investing in making these calls searchable, collecting common words, and trying to identify common threads of problems earlier.

So how can you accomplish the same without spending millions of dollars and months of effort?

The easiest way is to integrate your call recording system directly with OP3Nvoice. In fact, if you use a system like Twilio – which has Recording Callbacks – you can make the indexing near-realtime with almost no effort.
